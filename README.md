**AI Audio To Text Converter** is a next-generation transcription tool designed for **absolute privacy** and **zero latency**. Unlike other services that upload your audio to a third-party server, this tool runs entirely in your browser. It connects **directly** to Google's powerful Gemini AI using your own API key, ensuring your data never touches a middleman.

## 🔒 Security Architecture: How Your Key & Data Are Safe

We utilize a **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** architecture. This is the gold standard for privacy-conscious AI tools.

### 🛡️ The "Zero-Server" Guarantee
*   **No Database**: We have no database to store your audio or your keys.
*   **No Backend**: There is no "server" sitting between you and Google.
*   **Client-Side Storage**: Your API Key is saved strictly in your browser's `localStorage`. It persists on **your device only**.
*   **Direct Tunnel**: When you transcribe, the request goes from `Your User Device` ➔ `Google Servers`. It cannot be intercepted by us.

### 🔐 Input Hardening
We have implemented military-grade input validation:
*   **Magic Bytes Detection**: Prevents malware from disguising itself as audio files.
*   **Regex Validation**: Ensures only valid Google API Key formats (`AIza...`) are accepted.
*   **XSS Sanitization**: All inputs and outputs are sanitized to prevent script injection attacks.

## 🙋‍♀️ FAQ

**Q: Can you see my API Key?**
A: **No.** Your key is stored in your browser's local cache. If you clear your browser history, the key is gone. We have no access to it.

**Q: Is my audio uploaded to your server?**
A: **No.** We do not have a server. The audio travels directly from your computer to Google for processing and then straight back to you.

**Q: What audio formats are supported?**
A: We support `MP3`, `WAV`, `M4A`, `OGG`, and standard `MP4` video files.
